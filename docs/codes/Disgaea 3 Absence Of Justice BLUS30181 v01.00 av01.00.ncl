I did not make any Evility

the first Disgaea game to
ever have them I am
guessing many of these

L3 = Copy selected skill to HL value
R3 = Write HL value to selected skill
/\ = Reset bit value to 0001 and HL value to 0000
< = Shift bit left 1 bit
\/ = Apply bit to HL value

This will replace your HL
with an amount set so you
can visually see what
value you have so you will
know if you have the
correct value for a
certain skill.

If the selected slot has
no Special Skill, R3 will
not do anything.

To create a value of your
choice for a skill, you
will need to press
Triangle in the main area
or during battle so you
can see your current amount of HL.

To use this, go to
Special, select your
character, and move the
cursor over a skill of
your choice to either copy
the current skill or
overwrite it with 1 you
chose.

You can also manually edit
address 01F90226 with a
value of your choice if
you can write to memory
while playing.

Any of these values that
you choose during battle
are safe to use, but the
values do not save and
you will need to copy it
when you select a
character.

If you do this outside of
battle, anything that is 
not generic that you could
normally get for a
character from the Evility
guy will crash your game.

Get windows calculator and
set the mode to
programmer, you will need
it. While out of battle
press Triangle, or in
battle press Triangle.
You will see your HL value.
This code does not affect
your actual HL count, I am
just stealing the displayed
value for your visual aid.

I will use this as an example: 0324 = Omega Heal
0324 in windows calculator will show you these bits: 0000 0011 0010 0100
While looking at your displayed HL, you'd press this button combo while holding R2: URRDRRRDRRRDD, then go to your skill you want to replace and press R3 to replace it.
0324 as a decimal number is 804, and that's what you'll get. You then go to whatever character you want, get into their evility page, and then press Start + Up to make Fold Shop their 1st evility, or press Start + Down to make it their 2nd evility.
For the bits, you start with the first 1 farthest on the right. Every 0 you see you just press left to go left 1 bit, and every 1 you see you press down. It moves right to left.
0324 = 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
DLD L LLD L LLD L LU
087F = 2175 decimal = Crusher Bones = 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
D L L L LLDLDLDLDLDLDLDU
From there you have what you need, pick a skill of your choice and press R3 to replace it.

I did not make any Evility

L3 = Copy selected skill to HL value
R3 = Write HL value to selected skill
/\ = Reset bit value to 0001 and HL value to 0000
< = Shift bit left 1 bit
\/ = Apply bit to HL value

This will replace your HL
with an amount set so you
can visually see what
value you have so you will
know if you have the
correct value for a
certain skill.

If the selected slot has
no Special Skill, R3 will
not do anything.

To create a value of your
choice for a skill, you
will need to press
Triangle in the main area
or during battle so you
can see your current amount of HL.

To use this, go to
Special, select your
character, and move the
cursor over a skill of
your choice to either copy
the current skill or
overwrite it with 1 you
chose.

You can also manually edit
address 01F90226 with a
value of your choice if
you can write to memory
while playing.

Any of these values that
you choose during battle
are safe to use, but the
values do not save and
you will need to copy it
when you select a
character.

If you do this outside of
battle, anything that is 
not generic that you could
normally get for a
character from the Evility
guy will crash your game.

Get windows calculator and
set the mode to
programmer, you will need
it. While out of battle
press Triangle, or in
battle press Triangle.
You will see your HL value.
This code does not affect
your actual HL count, I am
just stealing the displayed
value for your visual aid.

I will use this as an example: 0324 = Omega Heal
0324 in windows calculator will show you these bits: 0000 0011 0010 0100
While looking at your displayed HL, you'd press this button combo while holding R2: URRDRRRDRRRDD, then go to your skill you want to replace and press R3 to replace it.
0324 as a decimal number is 804, and that's what you'll get. You then go to whatever character you want, get into their evility page, and then press Start + Up to make Fold Shop their 1st evility, or press Start + Down to make it their 2nd evility.
For the bits, you start with the first 1 farthest on the right. Every 0 you see you just press left to go left 1 bit, and every 1 you see you press down. It moves right to left.
0324 = 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
DLD L LLD L LLD L LU
087F = 2175 decimal = Crusher Bones = 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
D L L L LLDLDLDLDLDLDLDU
From there you have what you need, pick a skill of your choice and press R3 to replace it.
