Compiling
-------

This has been built using a makefile and my [VS Integration tools](https://github.com/Dnawrkshp/PS3-VS-Integration).
Ideally, you'd use Visual Studio to run and compile as normal. However the command line will still operate functionally.

For the following, only selfs can be packaged and run.
--
    Visual Studio
      Build           -   Set mode to Debug. Build as normal (F6)
      Run             -   Set mode to Debug. Run as normal (F5)
      Package         -   Set mode to Release. Build as normal (F6)
    Command Line
      Build           -   make
      Run             -   make run
      Package         -   make pkg
